VR Final Proj: 
- UI for DJ to control lighting
    - Pop up button UI for mode switching
    - Basic chill music selection
    - Some way to spin objects around the dj
- Extra:
    - Make world look nicer (video players for fx?), make bulbs/lighting more realistic

Remaining: 
* Some audio playing 
* fix collision bug
- make world look a bit nicer
- UI for mode/song switching
- basic attempt at animating shapes
- clean up code




Potential optimnizations:
- increase margin in detector collider
