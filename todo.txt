VR Final Proj: 
- Light collision logic
    - Another type of logic for LookAt spotlight/laser
- UI for DJ to control lighting
    - Interactive color change
        - 3D HSV space with click to lock in color
    - Pop up button UI for mode switching
    - Basic chill music selection
    - Some way to spin objects around the dj
- Extra:
    - Custom songs, video player, vp in 3d lights
    - Audio link
    - Change waviness of a object
    - Shape that take clicks and creates outward pulse
    - Start with basic shapes spawned. extra have shape spawner
    - Be able to move Mini world
    - Make world look nicer (video players for fx?), make bulbs/lighting more realisting
    - Strings connecting the balls to rafters
    - actual dj deck asset
    - lights are unoptimal, so sneak in a few actual responsive lights
    - bug for handling multiple objects at one spot


Tasks:
- table for more shape types
- start basic UI
- look into HSV color changing modes
- bug player colliding with detector box

Potential optimnizations:
- increase margin in detector collider
- shapes pickup are static instead of rigid
