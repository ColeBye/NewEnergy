VR Final Proj:
- Create World Environment
    - Box world
    - DJ stage middle
    - 3D array of light balls
    - Spawn room 
    - Mini world 
    - shapes(detectors)
- Light collision logic
    - Do a stress test for lots of area3d
    - Another type of logic for LookAt spotlight/laser
    - How to handle multiple shapes at same point (Lerp/avg colors?)
- Add basic movement, non physics based.
- UI for DJ to control lighting
    - Interactive color change
        - 3D HSV space with click to lock in color
    - Pop up button UI for mode switching
    - Basic chill music selection
    - Some way to spin objects around the dj
- Extra:
    - Custom songs, video player, vp in 3d lights
    - Audio link
    - Change waviness of a object
    - Shape that take clicks and creates outward pulse
    - Start with basic shapes spawned. extra have shape spawner
    - Be able to move Mini world
    - Make world look nicer (video players for fx?)
    - Strings connecting the balls to rafters
    - actual dj deck asset
    - lights are unoptimal, so sneak in a few actual responsive lights


Tasks:
- first test of logic for lights
- build up physical mini world and bulb array
