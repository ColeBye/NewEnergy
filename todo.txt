VR Final Proj: 
- UI for DJ to control lighting
    - Interactive color change
        - 3D HSV space with click to lock in color
    - Pop up button UI for mode switching
    - Basic chill music selection
    - Some way to spin objects around the dj
- Extra:
    - Custom songs, video player, vp in 3d lights
    - Make world look nicer (video players for fx?), make bulbs/lighting more realistic
    - actual dj deck asset
    - lights are unoptimal, so sneak in a few actual responsive lights
    - bug for handling multiple objects at one spot



Remaining: 
* Some audio playing 
* variety of colors
* fix collision bug
- make world look a bit nicer
- highlight selected objects/adjust selection radius




Potential optimnizations:
- increase margin in detector collider
- shapes pickup are static instead of rigid
